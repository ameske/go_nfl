A customized NFL Pick-Em Pool manager written in Go.

There weren't any pick-em managers that allowed one to set up customized scoring like the pool
that I run does. This is an automated pick-em-pool application that uses our scoring system.
The system works as follows. Each week, pick the winners of all of the games. Next, assign
point values to the games. You have one 7 point game, two 5 point games, and anywhere from
three to five 3 point games based on the number of byes in a week. The remainder of the games
are worth only one point.

This is a work in progress in my spare time, so I cannot make any guarantees to when I will
complete it. You are more than welcome to use any part of the application that you like. I
will try to keep an accurate report on what I'm working on and what I have completed.
